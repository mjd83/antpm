Userspace implementation of a wire protocol similar to the ANT/ANT+/ANT-FS protocols. The goal is to be able to communicate with the Forerunner 310XT (or any other ANT/ANT+/ANT-FS capable device) watch in order to retrieve sports tracks.

The C++ implementation is currently available under both Linux and win. Communication with watches other than the 310XT might (610XT, 910XT and Swim are likely) work, but are untested. This project currently does not yet support Forerunner 405, but work is underway for 405 support. Please report your experience to help improving the software.
